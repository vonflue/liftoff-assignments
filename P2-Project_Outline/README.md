## Submission Instructions

### Overview
My project is going to be an online martial arts instructional website exclusively for members of my Brazilian jiu-jitsu gym, Gracie St.Pete. Members will be able to log into a private site to access the instructionals for the lessons of the week in video format to study at their convenience.
### Features
User login: Paying members of the gym will have user login Ids to sign in to view instructional videos.
Search: Members will be able to search an archive of past lesson videos.
Library: Members will also have the ability to browse all videos in case they are not sure what to search for.
### Technologies
Python
Django
MySQL
Javascript
Html/CSS
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll definitely have to dive deeper into Javascript and CSS. Since its a fairly basic website I'd like to focus a lot on the design and layout. Also, I need to learn Django since we used Flask in class but decided to try Django for the challenge of a new framework.
